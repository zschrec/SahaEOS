This file contains the steps necessary to get AstroBEAR working on a given machine.
The assumed file structure is ~/Documents/AstroBEAR/
Where the AstroBEAR directory will have what we need.

Phase I: Obtaining the necessary files/packages

	-First, obtain the updated scrambler files (scrambler is the AstroBEAR source).
	This can be done by obtaining access to the AstroBEAR git repo. A user account must be obtained (Baowei). IF the version of AstroBEAR obtained needs to be set up via a configure

./configure --with-hdf5=/home/schrecengost/Documents/AstroBEAR/hdf5-1.8.13 --with-fftw3=/home/schrecengost/Documents/AstroBEAR/fftw-3.3.4 --with-hypre=/home/schrecengost/Documents/AstroBEAR/hypre-2.0.0/src/hypre

You must first download everything AstroBEAR needs, and THEN run configure. 

	-Next is to download everything that AstroBEAR needs to run:
		
		/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\

		Intel Fortran Compiler:
			- Download from https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-parallel-studio-xe

			- Extract files into AstroBEAR/ directory
			
	
			- run	>>	mkdir intel_compiler
					>>	./install.sh
	
				-  Follow Prompts: Evaluation -> custom install (uncheck IA-32, change installation directory to ../../AstroBEAR

		/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
		
		Open MPI:
			- Download from from http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.8/
				(Used openmpi-1.8.4.tar.gz)

			- Extract files into AstroBEAR/ directory
			
			- run	>>	cd ../../openmpi-1.8.4/
					>>	mkdir build
					>>	./configure --prefix=/home/USERNAME/Documents/AstroBEAR/openmpi-1.8.4/build
					>>	make all install

		/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
		
		HDF5:
			- Download from http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtainsrc.html
				(Used hdf5-1.8.13.tar.gz)
			
			- Extract files into AstroBEAR/ directory
					
			- run 	>>	./configure --prefix=/home/schrecengost/Documents/AstroBEAR/hdf5-1.8.13/ --enable-fortran --enable-cxx 
					>>	make
					>> make install						
	
		/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
		
		Hyper:
			- Download from https://computation-rnd.llnl.gov/linear_solvers/software.php
				(Used hypre-2.0.0.tar.gz)
			
			- Extract files into AstroBEAR/ directory

			- run 	>>	cd ../../hyper-2.0.0/src
					>>	mkdir build
					>>	export CC="gcc -lm"
					>>	./configure --prefix=../../AstroBEAR/hypre-2.0.0/src/build/ --with-MPI-include=../../AstroBEAR/openmpi-1.8.4/build/include
					>>	make install

		/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\

		FFTW:
			- Download from http://www.fftw.org/download.html
				(Used fftw-3.3.4.tar.gz)

			- Extract files into AstroBEAR/ directory
			
			- run 	>>	cd ../../fftw.3.3.4
					>>	./configure --prefix=/home/USERNAME/Documents/AstroBEAR/fftw-3.3.4
					>>	make

		/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\

Phase II: Configuring Makefile

	First:
		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../../AstroBEAR/hdf5-1.8.13/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

	NOTE:	As you run make in "scrambler" there will be errors that relate to path dependencies in 
			"includes". Just open up the file with the error in it and adjust the path to reflect
			your directory structure. If you have followed the directions carefully, all I believe
			should need to change is /home/YOURUSERNAME/Documents/

 
	Follow directions on https://astrobear.pas.rochester.edu/trac/wiki/CompilingAstroBear 
	to compile a problem. When typing >> make is when path errors will manifest themselves


	Follow directions on https://astrobear.pas.rochester.edu/trac/wiki/TestAstroBear to set up
	a run directory

	MAKE SURE ../run_dir/out IS EMPTY!!!



Phase III: Visualization

		/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
		
		VisIt: 
			- Download from https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/executables
				(Used Linux - x86_64 64 bit for Redhat Enterprise)
			
			- Move tar into AstroBEAR directory

			- run 	>>	mkdir visit
					>>	./visit_install.sh 2.8.1 linux-x86_64-rhel6 ../../AstroBEAR/visit
					>>	cd visit/bin
					>> 	./visit
			(if cannot find libpng12.so.0 -> install libpng12 as root)	

			- follow instructions on https://astrobear.pas.rochester.edu/trac/wiki/VisItBasics

			-  if visit gives you an error when trying to open *.hdf files, change file names to *.hdf5
